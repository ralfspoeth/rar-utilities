/**
 * This class provides the boilerplate code for a
 * {@link ManagedConnectionFactory} in an outbound resource adapter.
 * <p>
 * It uses the {@link DefaultConnectionManager} in non-managed environments.
 * <p>
 * Resource adapter implementations must implement the methods
 * {@link ManagedConnectionFactory#createConnectionFactory(jakarta.resource.spi.ConnectionManager)} and
 * {@link #createManagedConnection(Subject, ConnectionRequestInfo)}, the former
 * providing an instance of the client-level connection factory and the
 * latter providing an instance of the physical managed connection.
 * <p>
 * This implementation does not support connection matching.
 * <p>
 * The actual implementation should use the {@link ConnectionDefinition}
 * annotation. It should furthermore comply with the JavaBeans
 * specification (No-arg constructor, properties with getters and setters,
 * must be serializable which it already is).
 * <p>
 * Remember to implement both {@link #equals(java.lang.Object)} and
 * {@link #hashCode()}.
